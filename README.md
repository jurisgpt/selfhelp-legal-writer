## LegalIntake Pro — First-Mile Legal Intake Platform

A guided and collaborative intake system that captures structured legal narratives with real-time clarification and  auditability — built for self-help clients of court, law firms and legal aid organizations



## Overview

LegalIntake Pro transforms unstructured client stories into fact-complete intake drafts through a structured, user-friendly process with built-in review tools. Unlike traditional static forms or unstructured text entry, the platform integrates:
	•	Guided intake workflows
	•	Gap detection and real-time clarification
	•	Structured metadata capture
	•	Role-based collaboration between intake staff and reviewers
	•	Version history and audit trails
	•	Fact verification integrations
	•	Export and case management handoff

Designed for the first mile of legal work, this tool ensures important details are captured early, reducing follow-ups, accelerating case triage, and improving client experience.



## Key Features

1. Context Capture & Case Metadata

Users begin with a structured intake form to define:
	•	Case type (e.g., employment, housing, immigration)
	•	Jurisdiction (state/country and court level)
	•	Relevant dates (incident, notice, deadlines)
	•	Language preference
	•	Confidentiality level (public, internal, privileged)

Purpose: Enables the system to tailor questions and prioritize jurisdiction-specific requirements.



2. Guided Intake Flow

A step-by-step process ensures essential factual domains are addressed:
	1.	Parties involved
	2.	Sequence of events and timelines
	3.	Location of incidents
	4.	Harm or damages sustained
	5.	Prior communications with other parties

Each step includes clear guidance and practical examples to help users provide complete information. Users may switch between guided mode and free narrative entry at any time.



3. Gap Detection and Clarification

As information is entered, the system flags incomplete or inconsistent entries. Intake staff or designated reviewers can send clarification questions directly to the client within the platform, keeping the process moving without additional phone calls or emails.



4. Collaboration and Review

Role-based editing allows paralegals, intake specialists, and subject matter experts to:
	•	Suggest edits and annotate narratives
	•	Resolve factual ambiguities
	•	Capture cultural or linguistic nuances
	•	Approve or request revisions



5. Version History and Audit Trail

All changes are recorded with:
	•	Timestamps
	•	Author attribution
	•	Summary of changes
	•	Word counts

This ensures accountability and supports compliance with professional record-keeping standards.



6. Export and Handoff

Finalized case narratives can be exported in multiple formats, including:
	•	PDF,Word
	•	Email
